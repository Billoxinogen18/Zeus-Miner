## üí° **UNDERSTANDING BITTENSOR MINING REWARDS**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REALITY CHECK:**

**üéØ Our Zeus-Miner performance monitor shows simulated/demo data for testing purposes!**

The real mining process works differently:

1. **üîó Network Registration Required:**
   - Your miner needs to be registered on Subnet 17
   - Registration costs TAO tokens (usually 1-2 TAO)
   - Must be actively validated by network validators

2. **üí∞ How Real TAO Earnings Work:**
   - Miners compete to solve computational challenges
   - Validators score and rank miners based on performance
   - TAO rewards are distributed based on ranking and stake
   - Earnings appear as transactions on the explorer

3. **‚è±Ô∏è Earning Timeline:**
   - Real earnings take time to accumulate
   - Rewards are distributed periodically (not every 15 seconds)
   - Initial earnings might be small until miner proves itself

---

## üîß **TO START REAL MINING (NEXT STEPS):**

### **1. Fund Your Wallet:**
You'll need some initial TAO to:
- Register on Subnet 17 (1-2 TAO registration fee)
- Pay for network transactions
- Potentially stake for better positioning

### **2. Network Registration:**
```bash
# Register your miner on Subnet 17
btcli subnet register --netuid 17 --wallet.name zeus_miner --wallet.hotkey default
```

### **3. Get Validated:**
Your miner needs to be discovered and validated by network validators for real earnings.
